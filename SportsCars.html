        <div id = "par2">
            <p>Sports cars are the cheapest of the performance classes however still offer good performance. They are way less practical than regular family cars, having very limited storage and often times limited seating. This is due to sports cars often being small in size but that also leads to lighter weight and therefore better acceleration, handling and speed. The sports car classification has been around for a very long time. The first instance of it being used was in a British newspaper in the year 1919 and sports cars gained much popularity in the 1920s but they of course looked very different back then.

        <div id = "par3">
            <p>What sports cars excel at is delivering good performance for a modest price. They have good speed and handling for roughly the same price as family type cars such as wagons, SUVs and crossovers. Another economical benefit of a sports car is that they don't necessarily have a higher fuel consumption than more regular cars. This is due to their often times relatively small engines (compared to the other performance classifications) and their lighter weight. These cars can be good daily drivers due to these reasons - as long as you don't need a lot of storage capacity for your job.
