            <p>Not Good Daily Drivers</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "par2">
            <p>Cars that are developed for the track are very often really inefficent for daily use. This is because of a variety of factors. Track cars for instance have front and rear wings that provide more grip at the cost of drag efficiency. With the increased drag, more fuel is consumed and the extra grip you get is not at all necessary for regular road usage. Another reason these cars aren't the best for the street is because of the stiff suspension that they very often have. It is necessary for these cars to have stiff suspension because of the wings providing downforce, pushing the car to the ground. This in turn results in the driving experience being very bumpy and uncomfortable on normal roads.

        </div>
        <div id = "par3">
            <p>Obviously these cars are the best when it comes to setting fast laps around a track. An example of this is if we compare the track focused Porsche 911 GT3 RS vs a Rimac Nevera - an incredible electric hypercar. In a straight line, the Nevera is much faster, having a much quicker acceleration and having an entire 120km/h faster top speed. This is due to the Nevera having almost four times as much power and a four wheel drive system. If we however compare the track times off these cars on the famous Nordschleife in Germany, the 911 GT3 RS is an entire 21 seconds faster on the same tires. In the motorsport world, this is a completely enormous difference. If they would keep up the same pace, the Porsche would lap the Rimac Nevera after just over 2 hours and with some races lasting up to 24 hours, this just shows how much faster a track car is around a track even with only one quarter of the power.
