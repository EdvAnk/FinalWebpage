            <p>Hypercars are designed with one purpose: unmatched speed and horsepower. These cars are the most powerful road-going cars on the planet. Modern hypercars often have atleast 1500 horsepower but that number sometimes goes even higher.
                The term hypercar has no set definition but most people agree that it is a car with an extremely high price and extremely high performance. People are split about whether the first hypercar was the McLaren F1 (1993) or the Bugatti Veyron (2005) due to there not being an exact definition. More recently, hypercars have gone more towards electric and, hybrid drivetrains, just like the rest of the industry.</p>

        <div id = "par3">
            <p>Hypercars are exceedingly expensive due to their cutting-edge technology, limited production runs, and exceptional performance capabilities. These vehicles incorporate the latest advancements in automotive engineering, such as advanced aerodynamics, lightweight materials like carbon fiber, and powerful engines that often combine turbocharging with hybrid technology. Additionally, the exclusivity of hypercars, with only a few units produced, enhances their desirability and rarity, driving up costs. The development and manufacturing processes involve extensive research, precision craftsmanship, and customization options, all of which contribute to the high price tag. The brand prestige and the luxury experience they offer further justify their steep prices.</p>
