        <div id = "par2">
            <p>Supercars are known for their incredible performance. In terms of performance they are miles ahead of sports cars but not quite on the level of hypercars. If were talking horsepower, the average supercar has around three times as much as the average sports car. These cars often have a rear or mid mounted engine which is impractical in terms of storage capacity but provides superior weight distribution leading to better performance. Supercars sacrifice all practicality in order to gain performance and a cool reputation.

            <p>Flashy Looks</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "par3">
            <p>Supercars are designed to stand out among the crowd of other cars. Their body panels incorporate angles and shapes that are never seen on regular cars. Pair that with a vibrant colour which supercars often have and you have a car that you will not be able to miss. Due to their exotic looks, supercars are often featured in movies, music videos, instagram posts, etc. where they are shown off. They are very often only produced in limited numbers, which makes them rarer, pricier and more exclusive than sports cars.
